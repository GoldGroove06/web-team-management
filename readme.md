Distinctiveness and Complexity:
 This project requires different levels of authentication for different types of user with intergration of features accordingly.The use of modals for ui with dynamic behaviour of ui   makes a great experience. All of the pages are dynamic with help of apis in the backend. The integration of functional calendar gives a great overview with modal popup showing the info. It has error catching for the data inputed by user and works accordingly to show error to get desired inputs. Uses all methods of json input to work with data in backend. A lot of javascript is used for the dashboard and projects page to work. This includes from fetching the data with api as per user level to show information, PUT and Post to send back data.
